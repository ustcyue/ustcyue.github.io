        <h1>Xiaoning Yue</h1>
        <p>Currently, I'm a data engineer at <a href="http://www.dianping.com/">Dianping.com</a>, the biggest O2O company in China. I got my MSc degree with top honour from <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">USTC</a> in June 2013. My rsearch interets include parallel computing with GPU, distribute computing and big data.</p>

        <div><font size="3" color="Black"><strong>P-EFIT (2010-2013): </strong></font> A program used for fusion plasma equilibrium reconstruction developed by me.
          <div style='margin-top : 10px'>
            <ul>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 0px'>In order to fullfill the real-time control requirment, the program was written with CUDA-C. It could complete one compute iteration in 220 micorsecond and was the fastest equilibrium reconstruction program heretofore. </li>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>Plasma equilibrium is a kind of program used to identify plasma shape in the nuclear fusion device. It is the basis for fusion plasma shape control. But it conatins a series of complex computation, both numerically and logically, which make its speed much slower compared to the ideal spead for efficient feed-back control. It was originally defined as "non-parallelizable" and all previous attempts trying to parallelize it had failed.</li>  
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>P-EFIT successfuly accelerate this process by more than 10 times while improving its spatial resolution by four times.To achieve this, I designed several parallel algorithms in order to make full use of GPU resources. Including <strong>parallel block-tridiagonal solver</strong>(with DST method), <a href= "./pfix.html"> <strong>tri-diagonal solver</strong></a>, efficient algorithm for <strong>middle-scale(500-5000) matrix multiplication</strong>(two examples <a href = "./mats.html">here</a>), etc. More importantly, these algorithms were carefully optimized based on property of GPU architechture and I had built an efficient data transfer scheme with two host threads, and three buffers.</li>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>I had been doing this project from July, 2010 to June, 2013 in Computer Engineering Division,<a href="http://english.ipp.cas.cn/"> Institute of Plasma Physics, Chinese Academy of Science.</a> You can find more information about this project in <a href="#publications">my publications</a> and my <a href = "./papers/MT.pdf">master's thesis(in Chinese)</a>.</li>
             <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>I successfully got a 200000yuan (about $33000) Nature Science Foundation of China in 2012 for this research project.</a>  I was also awarded the national scholarship for graduate student for this work.</li>

            <ul>
              <li style = 'margin-top : 0px'>My main work in this department was interpreting unstructured data(server logs etc.) into structured data using hadoop and hive(ETL). For example, I had built a data model that tracing users' behaviour after they searched a keyword in our app or website(leave or not? which link they click? the click height etc) based on the server logs. I had also built a data model that traces the events after a push message was sent to one device.</li>
              <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>I also participate in the development of our own ETL framwork named Pandora. with this framwork, we only need to predefine the input and output schema and write a transform fucntion using plain java, then a map-reduce job would be build and the result would be automaticly loaded into a Hive table.</li>
              <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>During work, I wrote several UDF and UDTF for Hive in order to use it more conveniently and high efficiently.</li>
               <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>I had optimized several jobs on the longest path. For example, I had reduced the run time of a job from one hour into 10 minutes.</li>

            <ul>
              <li style = 'margin-top : 0px'>PBW is an important component at the end of High Energe Proton Accelerator. It is used to seperate the accelerator chamber(extremely vacuum) with the target room(full of helium gas, two barometric pressure). It had to suffer the impact of 1.6GeV proton beam. What's more, it should be as thin as possible so that protons would not loss much energe after passing it.</li>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>All exisited spallation neutron souces use water-cooled PBW. After carefully analysising and caculation based on the specific situation of CSNS(energy, beam phase, etc), I proposed a scheme that uses the helium gas in the target chamber to cool the PBW. In this way, the amount of high radiation water is reduced. Most importantly, less energy will loss when protons pass this window.</li>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>To verify its feasibility, I wrote a program in Fortran to simulate the process using finite-element method. It was the first time I wrote a practical program. When I finally got my program work correctly after developing and debugging for several weeks, I was amazed by the sense of accomplishment it brought to me. It felt like I had built a PBW in the virtual world with those codes. This is why I turned into CS.</li>
            <li style = 'margin-top : 5px'>I was awarded Outstanding Undergraduate Research Program of USTC for this program.</li>

        <h2><a name="course">Course Study</a></h2>
        <p>You may find that my undergraduate grades in the first three semesters are much worse than those of the following semesters. This was because that after three years' hard working in high school, I thought I have arrived my destination when finally got into the university. Therefore, I seldom went to the study hall after class in the first three semesters. However, I realized that I should change at the end of the third semester after a talk with my class advisor. I started working hard and my grade ranked top 10% in my class in the rest five semesters. I also ranked 1st in my master stage study.
         </p>
        <p>Although both my degree are not in Computer Science. I had taken a lot classes relationed to this, and achieved good grades, especially after the third semester. Such as Computational Methods(87), Probability Theory and Math Statistics(85), Computational Physics(95), Detailed Interpretation of Computer System(89), Modern Information Processing(91), Artificial Intelligence(90), System Simulation Modeling and Analysis(94).</p>
